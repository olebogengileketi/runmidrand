## PROJECT OBJECT
The main objective is to create a fully functional, database driven e-commerce website. The website will cover the full spectrum of the client’s operations: an e-commerce section for clothes, sound hire, a portfolio and booking interface for videography, and photography. The site will be accessible to various users, from those looking to purchase activewear to clients who want to make enquires, book or review videography and photography services and sound hire. Users will be able to communicate with the business owner through an integrated contact system. Core goals include increasing sales, improving client booking processes, and enhancing brand visibility by integrating all services into a single, cohesive online presence.
